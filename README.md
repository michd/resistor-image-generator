## Resistor image generator

I got [nerdsniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) into making this.

It's not finished at all, and the code is messy. The end goal it generate a
whole E-series worth of resistor images automatically, which at this point
is pretty achievable.

Requires "Pillow".

See example.png for example output for the value "567".
